WZH version of CMS Instrument for Masterclass Analysis (CIMA) (2019)

The CMS Instrument for Masterclass Analysis (CIMA) is a webapp used to help students tabulate and plot data from the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) detector of the Large Hadron Collider.  In a typical Masterclass, student groups in multiple locations around the world simultaneously interpret real data from the CMS experiment by entering it into CIMA for analysis in order to learn how physicists use accelerator data to identify subatomic particles like the W, Z, and Higgs bosons.

User functions include entering and characterizing CMS event data from external sources, reviewing tables of data entered from multiple locations, and viewing histogram charts of data entered from multiple locations.   Administrator functions include defining Masterclass events, assigning student groups to them, and assigning data files to each student group.

CIMA is maintained by QuarkNet in support of the [International Masterclass](http://www.physicsmasterclasses.org/) program of the International Particle Physics Outreach Group (IPPOG).

QuarkNet seeks volunteers proficient with PHP to assist in refactoring this program.  Experience with simple networked MySQL/PHP interfaces and JavaScript charting libraries similar to Charts.js are useful but not necessary.
